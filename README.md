Creating graphics with code is fun, but sometimes there is a lot of boilerplate. `Solandra` is a Flutter re-imagining of a TypeScript library for HTML 5 Canvas drawing.

## Features

* Easy iteration (which can be size aware)
* Easy randomness
* A higher level Path Class (something that you can operate on, but can draw a `Path`)
...

Dart and Flutter start with a stronger set of primitives than HTML 5 Canvas and the Javascript standard library (as it doesn't really exist).
